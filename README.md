# Jif Jenerator
Is it Gif or Jif? Either way, you know they are fun use and look at!

# Find GIFs of your current Vibe

## How do I generate GIFs?
It's easy! Click on a button to generate some cool GIFs of "that feeling when" moments. If you have a specific moment/mood/vibe in mind, you can add a button for it using that handy dandy "Add Vibe" box on the right.

## How do I get the GIFs to move?
It's also easy! Hover over one of the GIFs to see it in action. Once you move your mouse away, it'll stop.

## Do I have to only look for Show?
No. If your heart so desires, you can actually search for any GIF you want. Enter your search term into the "Add your Vibe" box, and a button for it will appear. 

## How is GIF pronounced?
It's pronounced "jif". The man who invented them said so .... This is not up for debate.

## Programming notes
* PLEASE GO TO https://developers.giphy.com/ TO GET YOUR OWN KEY
* Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript/jQuery
* Had users hover over a GIF to play it instead of clicking on it, although I also wrote working code for the click function (commented out in the jif.js file)
* Additional feature: Users cannot add a button that already exists, and if they attempt to do so, an error message will display and the existing button will be highlighted
